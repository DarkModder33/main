- Status: checkpoint complete.

### 2026-02-19 - Phase 2 Checkpoint 7 Complete
- Added provider abstraction layer:
  - `lib/intelligence/provider.ts`
  - Supports env-driven mode selection: `mock` or `vendor`.
  - Adds provider metadata (`source`, `vendor`, `configured`, `simulated`).

  - dark pool prints
  - crypto flow triggers
  - catalyst news for watched symbols

### 2026-02-19 - Phase 2 Checkpoint 9 Complete
