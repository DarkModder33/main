{"instruction": "How does DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging) work?", "response": "DCA involves investing fixed amounts regularly (e.g., $100/week) regardless of price.

{"instruction": "What is a rug pull?", "response": "A rug pull is a scam where developers abandon a project and steal investor funds.

{"instruction": "Explain market sentiment", "response": "Market sentiment = collective trader emotions (fear/greed). Measured by: Fear & Greed Index, social media buzz, whale movements, funding rates. Extreme fear = possible bottom, extreme greed = possible top. Use with technical analysis for better decisions."}
{"instruction": "What is yield farming?", "response": "Yield farming = earning returns by providing liquidity or staking. You earn fees from trades (as LP) or staking rewards.

{"instruction": "Explain slippage", "response": "Slippage = price difference between expected and actual execution price. Caused by: low liquidity, large orders, market volatility. Example: expect $100 but get $99. More common with small tokens. Minimize by: using aggregators (Jupiter), trading liquid pairs, smaller size."}
{"instruction": "What are utility tokens?", "response": "Utility tokens grant access to services/features in a protocol. Not securities.
