{"instruction":"Give me a premarket checklist for swing trading US stocks.","response":"Premarket swing checklist: 1) Scan earnings/news catalysts, 2) Mark key levels from prior day high/low + premarket range, 3) Confirm liquidity and spread quality, 4) Define entry trigger + invalidation, 5) Cap risk to 1-2% account per trade, 6) Set profit targets and trailing plan, 7) Journal thesis before entry.","category":"stock_trading"}
{"instruction":"How should I compare BTC, ETH, and SOL for a 90-day allocation?","response":"Use a thesis matrix: BTC (macro reserve, lower beta), ETH (ecosystem + fees, medium beta), SOL (high growth + higher volatility). For 90 days, define target weights, rebalance schedule (weekly/bi-weekly), max drawdown stop, and event risks (ETF flows, upgrades, macro rates). Keep stablecoin buffer for volatility." ,"category":"crypto_portfolio"}
{"instruction":"Build a risk-managed intraday plan for crypto.","response":"Intraday crypto plan: trade only liquid pairs, risk <=0.5-1% per position, avoid overtrading (max 3-5 setups/day), require confluence (structure + volume + momentum), predefine stop and take-profit, pause after 2 consecutive losses, and review end-of-day stats." ,"category":"crypto_trading"}
{"instruction":"Explain options flow and dark pool in plain language.","response":"Options flow shows where large options money is positioning (direction, size, urgency).

Neither is a guaranteed signal alone; use them as context with trend, earnings calendar, and liquidity to avoid false positives." ,"category":"stock_education"}
{"instruction":"How do I avoid liquidation when using leverage on crypto futures?","response":"Use lower leverage, smaller position size, wider invalidation based on volatility (ATR), hard stop-loss, isolated margin, and strict max daily loss. Never average down on high leverage. If funding and volatility spike, reduce exposure." ,"category":"crypto_risk"}
{"instruction":"Create a weekly market routine for stocks and crypto.","response":"Weekly routine: Monday macro calendar + earnings map, daily premarket scan, midweek performance audit, Friday risk reset and journal review. Track win rate, expectancy, average R multiple, and mistakes by setup type. Rebalance portfolio only on schedule." ,"category":"market_process"}

{"instruction":"Design a 4-week guitar practice plan for busy adults.","response":"Week 1: chord changes + timing. Week 2: strumming patterns + song fragments. Week 3: scales + simple improvisation.

{"instruction":"How can an artist grow on YouTube and Instagram efficiently?","response":"Use a repeatable content loop: 1 long-form lesson/performance, 3-5 short clips, strong thumbnail/title hook, clear CTA, and weekly analytics review (retention + saves + click-through). Publish consistently and repurpose content across platforms." ,"category":"music_growth"}
{"instruction":"What tech stack is best for a fast MVP web app?","response":"For rapid MVPs: Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind + serverless APIs + managed Postgres/Supabase. Add analytics, auth, and feature flags early. Optimize for deployment speed, observability, and iterative user feedback over premature complexity." ,"category":"tech_product"}
{"instruction":"How do I improve app reliability after launch?","response":"Use error tracking, structured logs, health checks, rate limits, alerting, and staged rollouts.
