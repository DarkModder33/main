{"instruction":"Give me a premarket checklist for swing trading US stocks.","response":"Premarket swing checklist: 1) Scan earnings/news catalysts, 2) Mark key levels from prior day high/low + premarket range, 3) Confirm liquidity and spread quality, 4) Define entry trigger + invalidation, 5) Cap risk to 1-2% account per trade, 6) Set profit targets and trailing plan, 7) Journal thesis before entry.","category":"stock_trading"}
{"instruction":"How should I compare BTC, ETH, and SOL for a 90-day allocation?","response":"Use a thesis matrix: BTC (macro reserve, lower beta), ETH (ecosystem + fees, medium beta), SOL (high growth + higher volatility). For 90 days, define target weights, rebalance schedule (weekly/bi-weekly), max drawdown stop, and event risks (ETF flows, upgrades, macro rates). Keep stablecoin buffer for volatility." ,"category":"crypto_portfolio"}
{"instruction":"Build a risk-managed intraday plan for crypto.","response":"Intraday crypto plan: trade only liquid pairs, risk <=0.5-1% per position, avoid overtrading (max 3-5 setups/day), require confluence (structure + volume + momentum), predefine stop and take-profit, pause after 2 consecutive losses, and review end-of-day stats." ,"category":"crypto_trading"}
{"instruction":"Explain options flow and dark pool in plain language.","response":"Options flow shows where large options money is positioning (direction, size, urgency). Dark pool prints show large off-exchange stock transactions. Neither is a guaranteed signal alone; use them as context with trend, earnings calendar, and liquidity to avoid false positives." ,"category":"stock_education"}
{"instruction":"How do I avoid liquidation when using leverage on crypto futures?","response":"Use lower leverage, smaller position size, wider invalidation based on volatility (ATR), hard stop-loss, isolated margin, and strict max daily loss. Never average down on high leverage. If funding and volatility spike, reduce exposure." ,"category":"crypto_risk"}
{"instruction":"Create a weekly market routine for stocks and crypto.","response":"Weekly routine: Monday macro calendar + earnings map, daily premarket scan, midweek performance audit, Friday risk reset and journal review. Track win rate, expectancy, average R multiple, and mistakes by setup type. Rebalance portfolio only on schedule." ,"category":"market_process"}
{"instruction":"What should a beginner learn first in guitar?","response":"Start with posture, fretting-hand pressure, alternate picking, open chords, and rhythm counting with a metronome. Build consistency first: 20-30 minutes/day focused on clean transitions and steady timing before complex solos." ,"category":"music_education"}
{"instruction":"Design a 4-week guitar practice plan for busy adults.","response":"Week 1: chord changes + timing. Week 2: strumming patterns + song fragments. Week 3: scales + simple improvisation. Week 4: play-through + recording for feedback. Keep sessions short, measurable, and repeat difficult bars slowly before tempo increase." ,"category":"music_guitar"}
{"instruction":"How can an artist grow on YouTube and Instagram efficiently?","response":"Use a repeatable content loop: 1 long-form lesson/performance, 3-5 short clips, strong thumbnail/title hook, clear CTA, and weekly analytics review (retention + saves + click-through). Publish consistently and repurpose content across platforms." ,"category":"music_growth"}
{"instruction":"What tech stack is best for a fast MVP web app?","response":"For rapid MVPs: Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind + serverless APIs + managed Postgres/Supabase.

{"instruction":"What makes a good AI chat UX for finance users?","response":"Good finance chat UX is precise and auditable: show assumptions, confidence/uncertainty, source context, scenario outputs, and next actions. Keep language concise, avoid guarantees, and provide quick controls for timeframe, risk, and strategy." ,"category":"tech_ai"}
{"instruction":"Write a beginner-friendly songwriting workflow for guitar players.","response":"Start with a simple progression (ex: G-D-Em-C), loop it at slow tempo, hum a melody before writing lyrics, then lock in a chorus hook first. Build verses with contrast (lower melody), add a bridge for lift, and finish by trimming extra words to keep lines singable.","category":"music_creation"}
{"instruction":"How do I turn a guitar riff into a full song?","response":"Use the riff as your chorus anchor. Then create: 1) verse progression with less intensity, 2) pre-chorus that rises rhythmically/harmonically, 3) bridge that shifts key center or texture, 4) outro variation of chorus motif. Keep one recurring melodic idea to unify sections.","category":"music_creation"}
{"instruction":"Give me a 30-minute daily guitar composition routine.","response":"10 min: chord/rhythm exploration with metronome. 10 min: melody writing over one progression. 5 min: lyric or title brainstorming. 5 min: record rough idea + notes. End each session with one actionable next step for tomorrow.","category":"music_guitar"}
{"instruction":"How can I write better chord progressions for modern pop-rock?","response":"Use a stable diatonic base (I-V-vi-IV, vi-IV-I-V), then add color with sus2/sus4, slash bass movement, or borrowed iv chord for emotional contrast. Keep harmonic rhythm simple and let melody/rhythm carry uniqueness.","category":"music_creation"}
{"instruction":"What is a practical arrangement template for solo artist guitar songs?","response":"Template: Intro (4-8 bars), Verse 1, Pre, Chorus, Verse 2, Pre, Chorus, Bridge, Final Chorus, Outro. Add layers per section: verse sparse, chorus fuller, bridge contrast. Introduce one new texture every section to maintain momentum.","category":"music_arrangement"}
{"instruction":"How do I create strong vocal melodies while playing guitar?","response":"Write melody away from the fretboard first by singing over a loop. Prioritize stepwise motion, reserve bigger jumps for emotional peaks, and place long notes on important lyric words. Then simplify guitar rhythm under vocal phrases so the melody leads.","category":"music_creation"}
{"instruction":"Teach me how to make my chord changes sound cleaner on electric guitar.","response":"Use minimum-pressure fretting, keep fingers close to strings, practice pairwise transitions (e.g., G->D only), mute with both hands, and train at 50-60 BPM before tempo jumps. Record close-up audio to catch noise between changes.","category":"music_education"}
{"instruction":"How should I structure a guitar lesson plan for absolute beginners?","response":"Week 1-2: posture, tuning, basic rhythm, open chords. Week 3-4: chord transitions and strumming patterns. Week 5-6: simple songs + timing discipline. Week 7-8: intro to scales and ear training. Track progress with short performance checkpoints.","category":"music_education"}
{"instruction":"What are the fastest ways to improve rhythm guitar timing?","response":"Practice with metronome on beats 2 and 4, then on only beat 1. Subdivide aloud (1e+a), accent different subdivisions, and loop 2-bar strumming patterns until consistent. Record and check if attacks land ahead/behind click.","category":"music_guitar"}
{"instruction":"How do I produce a demo-quality guitar track at home?","response":"Record clean DI + mic amp if possible, double-track rhythms and pan L/R, high-pass around 70-100Hz, cut harsh 2.5-4k if needed, add short room reverb, and automate volume for section dynamics. Prioritize tight performance before heavy processing.","category":"music_production"}
{"instruction":"What is a simple mixing chain for acoustic guitar in singer-songwriter songs?","response":"Chain: HPF (80-100Hz), gentle subtractive EQ (boxiness 200-400Hz), light compression (2:1, slow attack), optional de-esser for pick noise, short plate/room reverb, and subtle saturation. Keep acoustic centered unless arrangement needs width.","category":"music_production"}
{"instruction":"How can I make my guitar solos more musical, not just fast?","response":"Target chord tones on strong beats, use motifs and rhythmic repetition, leave space between phrases, and build intensity in waves. Limit note choices intentionally, then vary articulation (slides, bends, vibrato) for expression.","category":"music_creation"}
{"instruction":"Give me a workflow for writing lyrics that match guitar phrasing.","response":"Draft melody syllables first, map stressed words to strong beats, keep line lengths consistent per section, and sing-test every line at final tempo. Replace awkward multisyllabic words with clearer phrases that land naturally on cadence points.","category":"music_creation"}
{"instruction":"How do I prepare guitar content that performs on short-form social media?","response":"Hook in first 1-2 seconds with a recognizable riff, clear on-screen promise, 15-35 second focused value, then CTA (full lesson/tab link). Batch record variations of same concept and A/B test captions/thumbnails weekly.","category":"music_growth"}
{"instruction":"What’s a practical ear-training plan for guitarists who write songs?","response":"Daily 10 minutes: interval recognition (up/down), sing scale degrees over a drone, transcribe short melodies by ear, then harmonize with triads on guitar. Weekly: transcribe one chorus progression and one melody phrase from reference songs.","category":"music_education"}
{"instruction":"How do I build a signature guitar tone for my own music identity?","response":"Pick a core amp profile, one drive flavor, one modulation texture, and one ambience style. Keep gain conservative, tune EQ around your vocal range, and save 2-3 scene presets (verse/chorus/lead). Consistency across tracks builds recognizable identity.","category":"music_creation"}
