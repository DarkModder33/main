# Legacy Games Directory

This directory contains legacy HTML game files that were previously served at the root of the repository.

## About These Files

These are standalone HTML game files that were part of an earlier version of the project:
- Classic retro games (Snake, Tetris, Memory, Spades)
- Emulator-based games (Mario, Zelda, NES/SNES games)
- Game utilities and dashboards

## Current Status

These files have been moved here to prevent conflicts with the modern Next.js application deployment. The main website now uses:
- Next.js for the modern web application
- `/game` route for the Hyperborea game
- Static export deployed to GitHub Pages

## Accessing Legacy Games

If you need to access these legacy game files:
1. They remain in the repository for historical purposes
2. You can view them locally by opening the HTML files in a browser
3. They are not deployed to the production site (tradehaxai.tech)

## Migration Note

The new platform focuses on:
- **Hyperborea Game** - Modern blockchain-integrated game at `/game`
- **Trading Platform** - Advanced trading features at `/dashboard`
- **Music Education** - Guitar lessons and artist showcase at `/music`
- **Tech Services** - Full-service tech offerings at `/services`

The legacy games functionality has been superseded by the integrated platform experience.
