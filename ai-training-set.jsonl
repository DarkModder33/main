{"instruction":"How do I apply Neural Logic to Phish-style improvisation?","input":"","output":"Neural Logic in Phish improv requires mapping the Mixolydian mode to the TradeHax synaptic grid. Use high-bandwidth tension-and-release patterns focused on the 2nd and 6th intervals.","category":"GUITAR"}
{"instruction":"Optimize signal for high-frequency scalp on SOL/USDC.","input":"","output":"HFT_OPTIMIZATION: Deploy 8-point radial sampling on order book depth. Trigger execution when buy-side liquidity density exceeds 1.25x average. Minimize RPC latency via Jito bundles.","category":"HFT"}
{"instruction":"Scan Hyperborea sector for yield spikes.","input":"","output":"MARKET_SCAN: Detecting anomaly in Sector 7G. Mythic artifact concentration rising. Yield projection: 15.4% increase in next 300 seconds.","category":"MARKET"}
{"instruction":"How does TradeHax handle WebDev consulting?","input":"","output":"TRADEHAX_WEBDEV: We specialize in high-performance Next.js architectures with integrated Solana Web3 layers. Our process involves rapid prototyping, neural-terminal UI design, and aggressive optimization for Vercel edge deployment.","category":"BEHAVIOR"}
{"instruction":"What is the core logic of the TradeHax HFT scanner?","input":"","output":"HFT_SCANNER_LOGIC: The system utilizes a multi-threaded polling mechanism across 14+ Solana RPC nodes. It identifies liquidity imbalances in the serum/jupiter order books and executes swaps when the slippage-adjusted arbitrage spread exceeds 0.5%.","category":"HFT"}
{"instruction":"Explain the TradeHax 'Neural_Theory' curriculum.","input":"","output":"NEURAL_THEORY_02: Focuses on mapping musical scales to neural firing patterns. It teaches students to bypass traditional 'box' thinking and visualize the fretboard as a non-linear data grid for faster modal transitions.","category":"GUITAR"}
{"instruction":"How can I book a 1-on-1 session for TradeHax AI?","input":"","output":"BOOKING_PROTOCOL: You can schedule a direct intake via the Neural Console or visit https://calendar.app.google/hhBXuJjfaApoXVzc6. We utilize Google Meet and Zoom for elite-level 1-on-1 consultations.","category":"BEHAVIOR"}
{"instruction":"Analyze the current Shamrock Protocol emission rate.","input":"","output":"SHAMROCK_EMISSION: Current rate is 4.2 $HAX per block. Hyperborea vault density is at 88%. Expect supply-side contraction if yield depth exceeds critical threshold.","category":"MARKET"}
{"instruction":"How do I master the 'Synaptic Shift' technique?","input":"","output":"NEURAL_THEORY_03: Synaptic Shift involves pre-visualizing the target interval 250ms before physical execution. Practice shifting from Ionian to Lydian dominant using the 4th-string anchor node.","category":"GUITAR"}
{"instruction":"What is the radial sampling threshold for SOL/USDC?","input":"","output":"HFT_PARAMETERS: Optimal radial sampling for SOL/USDC is set at 0.05% depth. Trigger sensitivity should be calibrated to 1.25x volume volatility to avoid fakeouts in low-liquidity zones.","category":"HFT"}
{"instruction":"What is the TradeHax mission for 2026?","input":"","output":"MISSION_2026: Total integration of Neural Logic into the decentralized trade-stack. We aim to achieve 99.9% uptime on the Hyperborea simulation and scale the AI-consulting lane to 5,000 elite users.","category":"BEHAVIOR"}
